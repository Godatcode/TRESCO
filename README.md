## ⚙️ **Getting Started**

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – for cloning the repository
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any code editor of your choice

### 📦 Environment Variables

- Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
- The file already contains the required **Supabase API Keys**
- ⚠️ These keys are essential to connect with the preconfigured backend (no need to generate your own Supabase project)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> 📝 You are good to go after setting up the environment variables — the database and storage are already handled!

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Godatcode/TRESCO.git
cd TRESCO
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

A `.env.example` file is provided with required keys.

Copy it and rename to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Note:** The `.env.example` already includes the Supabase keys used in the project. You **do not need** to create your own—these are essential to access the hosted database and preloaded cultural experiences.
 ### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
